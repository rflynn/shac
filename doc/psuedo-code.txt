Concepts
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  file

    user (owner)
    group
    other
    
  path

    a path is a series of zero or more dir-or-symlink followed by an optional non-directory-file

    when serialized the path tokens are joined with a separator char '/'

  directory
    a file that only holds other files

  user
  
    root user

  group
  
  mount point

    

  permission

    sticky
      The sticky permission. The typical behaviour of the sticky bit on executable files encourages the kernel to retain the resulting process image beyond termination. On a directory, the sticky permission prevents users from renaming, moving or deleting contained files owned by users other than themselves, even if they have write permission to the directory. Only the directory owner and superuser are exempt from this. <URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system_permissions#Traditional_Unix_permissions>

    None   = 0x0
    Read   = 0x1
    Write  = 0x2
    Exec   = 0x4
    Create = 0x8
    Delete = 0x10

  File Status
    when we attempt to read a file path, what can happen?
      OK: 
      UnknownError: 
      SymlinksTooDeep: 

  File Permission Reason
    why a file / permission was false

    NoRead: Read permission required but not available.
    NoWrite: Write permission required but not available.
    NoExec: Exec permission required but not available.
    NoCreate: Create permission required but not available.
    NoDelete: Delete permission required but not available.
    MntPtReadOnly: Write permission required but directory's mountpoint is read-only.
    MntPtNoExec: Write permission required but directory's mountpoint is no-exec (nx).
    Sticky: 
    Dependency:
      deleting a directory requires that all child files and folders must be recursively deletable.
      this reason indicates that a directory is directly deletable but contain one or more files or directories
      that cannot be.
    Uncertain:
      the user under which the program is executing does not have read permission on one or more files/directories;
      meaning we cannot know the correct answer.
