added 3 verbosity levels, toggleable with -v, -vv and -vvv
each shows a different level of info

trying to clean out all the leaks... had a bunch of trouble
but i think i tracked most of it down. just noticed that
./shac -pd / thinks that "/" is mounted read-only, i'll have
to take a look at that

worked on getting recursive delete checking done, but it's not quite
there yet, code is sitting on my home box. ruben in #php, a big OpenBSD
fan, says that shac compiles and executes without a glitch
on OpenBSD 3.5-current. yay!

i've got the basics of recursive delete checking done, seems to work ok
because of the way things are structured we only check files in a
	breadth-first check, then if they check out, then we check all dirs
	underneath...
adding some things to the TODO...

* trying to get shac to compile on freebsd, changes:
	* mntent.h doesn't exist on freebsd
	* user_from_uid is defined in stdlib.h on freebsd
	* mntpt access is totally different on FreeBSD than with glibc

shac now works FreeBSD, should be r17. have to test on Linux
