TODO LIST

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* more static buffers, fewer mallocs

* directory deletion perms (BASICALLY DONE)
	currently does *not* work
	need to recurse through every file and subdir

* mounting noexec
	i'm pretty sure mountpoints can be specified noexec, yet i see no
	documentation of that in glibc. should be simple to actually
	implement, i just want to do it right

* create
	currently works in simple situations
	have to pay attention to sticky bit, should be ok
	what to do about create and an existing file? dir should be "can i
	create a file in this dir"... i think create and a file should be
	the same as delete...

* flock
	check if file is locked by an active process, this was recommended
	by jason at work, and is a good idea

* networked filesystems
	i don't know anything about how permissions work here, this'll be
	something i'll have to research

* explore permissions
	there are so many weird circumstances in the world of UNIX perms...
	i'm sure the code is probably about 50% right, maybe not even
	investigate situations on an ongoing basis

* add all kinds of cool things to the svn repository, like hooks for
	creating web-available tar.gz archives per every commit. testing
	hooks now with this change. more. testing hook. more tests. and more.
